# shopping-site
I created a basic online shopping site to help promote my grandparents’ muscat grape business.
My grandparents are muscat farmers who sell their grapes every summer in front of their house. However, because the only way to purchase was through direct, in-person sales, the number of customers was limited, and overall sales efficiency was low.

To solve this problem, I came up with the idea of launching an e-commerce site that would enable customers from all over Japan to buy the grapes online. This expansion makes it possible to reach buyers from Hokkaido to Okinawa and is expected to increase both accessibility and overall sales revenue.
